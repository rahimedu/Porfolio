            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Edwins Junior </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Bhubaneswar, India.</span>
            <br />I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2019 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.

Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

    JavaScript (ES6+)
    TypeScript
    React
    Eleventy
    Node.js
    WordPress
            
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Playing Chess
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Writing Tech Blogs
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Travelling
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={{ color: "rgb(155 126 172)" }}>
            "Strive to build things that make a difference!"{" "}
          </p>
          <footer className="blockquote-footer">EdwinsJunior</footer>
        </blockquote>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
